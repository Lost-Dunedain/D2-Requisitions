## Destiny 2 Requisitions

### About
This is a wishlist for Destiny Item Manager curated by Lost_Dunedain.

### Purpose
The default wish lists contain generally "god rolls" for each weapon's perk pool.  While this is very useful, it results in a lot of weapons with similar perk combinations.  This wish list focuses on combinations of perks that are unique to an individual weapon, or at least rather rare to find.  This is for better or for worse, being unique does not necessarily mean being good.  However, for those who wish to try them out regardless, this wishlist makes identification of these weapons quick and easy.

### Methodology
While I would consider myself a longtime Destiny player (started in House of Wolves), I have neither the expertise nor the time to compile this list on my own.  Much of the initial research was based on SpaceMoankey's Weapon Guide, as they tend to highlight unique perk combinations.  The weapon guide discusses all weapons through Season 20, and I highly recommend checking out the original document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KGxePntz2loCYlAhdKm0fJyyf_YURJ1Zd7L1smsu4-c/edit?pli=1).

After selecting a weapon, I searched the 3rd and 4th perk columns for combinations of perks that stood out as being potentially unique (e.g, seeing a damage boosting perk in both column 3 and column 4) I then used [D2 Foundry](https://d2foundry.gg) to search for other weapons in the chosen weapons archetype for the same combination.  If none were found, the roll was added to the list.  The roll was also added to the list if the perk combo was shared with other weapons, but those weapons had special restrictions on their use and/or acquisition (such as a sunset weapon or a raid weapon).  When able, I also added notes as to why the roll was included.

### Thank you.
If you're still reading this, thank you for taking the time to do so, and I hope this little reference helps while sorting through the spoils of RNGesus.
